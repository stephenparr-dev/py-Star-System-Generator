# star-system-generator
Star system generator based on the 2300AD GDW RPG rules
Coded in Python (3.7) using PyCharm Community IDE.

Eventual aim is to have a version mirroring the pen and paper system, then to create an updated version with tweaks for realism as per The Lair of Evil Dr Ganymede.
This will then, hopefully, be taken further by incorporating ideas from other systems (Mindjammer, GURPS Space, W.O.I.N.'s N.E.W., and Stars Without Number, to name a few (plus the - sadly incomplete - World Generation document by Tyge Sj√∂strand).
